Text2SQL Agent (Framework-Free)
This repository contains a framework-free Text2SQL agent designed to convert natural language queries into SQL commands. Unlike typical implementations that rely on frameworks like LlamaIndex or LangGraph, this project focuses on building the entire pipeline from scratch for enhanced transparency, flexibility, and fine-grained control.
